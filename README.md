Tired of running Google Chrome with arguments **in terminal**? 

Install this "Chrome" app (and add to Dock if you want) and use instead of Google Chrome.

Google Chrome needs to be installed separately. This app doesn't change anything about Google Chrome, everything works the same (settings, updates, etc.), except Google Chrome is run with custom flags.

By default app use flag `--disable-features=GlobalMediaControls` to disable annoying extension which controls running music, but you can modify flags any way you want. See: [run.sh](https://github.com/feegloo/chrome/blob/master/Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/run.sh)

### Installation

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feegloo/chrome/master/install | bash
```

Open "Chrome" app, then allow macOS to run app from "unidentified developer" in System Preferences / Security & Privacy / General

### Code

App contains only 3 files:
- [run.sh](https://github.com/feegloo/chrome/blob/master/Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/run.sh) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shell script executed when app is run
- [icon.icns](https://github.com/feegloo/chrome/blob/master/Chrome.app/Contents/Resources/icon.icns) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; app icon
- [Info.plist](https://github.com/feegloo/chrome/blob/master/Chrome.app/Contents/Info.plist) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; app descriptor, containing mostly dummy info

App is installed at `/Applications/Chrome.app/`, but you can rename `Chrome` to any name.

Treat it like a template for macOS app which runs Shell script.
